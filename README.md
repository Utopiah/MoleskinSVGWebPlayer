# todo
- parameters via URL, anchor target for checkpoints, a la reveal.js
  - especially URL as it would allow anybody to use the tool without having to repliace the Glitch (but then must be stable and compatible)
- play bar supporting seeking (0 being first stroke, 100 last)
- refactor to proper web component
- synced with video (cf ML tutorial with Yannael https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ml-vr?path=videoannotations.html:1:0 )  
- social synced https://glitch.com/edit/#!/localvideo-webxr-coplay?path=public/js/scripts.js:12:0 especially for presentations
- 3D/XR support, failed attempt in 3d.html
