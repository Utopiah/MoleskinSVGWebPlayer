# todo
- add matching video and audio examples for mediasync
- properly merge editor and mediasync (both work independantly but with the same code i.e `svgplayer.js`)
- parameters via URL (beyond just target svg)
- play bar supporting seeking (0 being first stroke, 100 last)
- refactor to proper web component
- social synced [cf own 360 social player](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/localvideo-webxr-coplay), especially for presentations
- 3D/XR support, failed attempt in 3d.html
