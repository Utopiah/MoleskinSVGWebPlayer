    <h1>SVG web player for hand drawing devices</h1>
    <p>Drawing helps to think about complex system. 
      As we draw we find link and become able to summarize.
      Unfortunately the final drawing is often incomprehensible for others because the explanations that was done with the drawing is gone. 
      As importantly the chronology of the drawing is also lost.
      The goal of thise player is to enable replaying of chronology and efficient sharing.
